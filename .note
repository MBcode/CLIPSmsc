do NOT use pins2km nor km-tax considering malecoli cl-kb then lisa.sf.net
  cl-kb just has pprj&xml file, but can export the pont&pins but just sys-slots vs. full hierarchy 
  change pprj type to pont/pins looses the same info; assume it was the experimental-xml file,might be able to convert this

Look at r-device code again, when I can, as a way to get triples out &more?; though protege has mult save-as/transform opts
 Found it after the o-device code; it still loads, might try o code next; could be useful, but would still like2get back2lisp

using agraph&gruff and asking for connections might be nice    

;still prolog-tab &km-tax if it worked better 
also
pins2km .sed
small fix to sed, can handle some more files, but use clean input
 it turns out that doing an agrep to get a subset of instances can break some(long?)lines 
 100+M files take @least on the order of the time(longer) that clips takes to load ;not sure abt lisa

;aside i've always wanted a fwd chainer on agraph, more like lispworks knowledge-based product

find-ins-str was written&commited on another machine, but didn't show up; have to check on this

save*ins2 can be useful to restrict what to load, and for greping seperated files
