I haven't looked at this in years, &should of put it on the clips list then.
It has been long forgotten/tossed, so hopefully someone will want to revivie it.
I've been meaning to clean up similar code in Lisp, &see if generic ffi's are easier than clips's.
Not sure of ownership/etc, other than it was made w/public funds(by me)&forgotten.
