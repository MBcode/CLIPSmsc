
Version 2.0
===========
- Support for owl:AllDisjointClasses

- Add (load-rules) function for loading rule programs
  on top of O-DEVICE. 


Version 1.2
===========
- Support for owl:propertyChainAxiom

- New function: (owl-insert-values$) for inserting multiple
  instance slot values

- New defglobal variable (?*imports*) in order to control 
  the processing of the imported ontologies

- Support for qualified cardinality restrictions (partially)

- Support for owl:hasKey property

- Add functions for backing-up/restoring instances

- The restore-instance* function checks also for the 
  existence of the instance slots


Version 1.1
===========
- Code optimizations: 
	- many functions have been re-written
	- some redundant rules have been removed (e.g. the collect-restrictions.clp)


Version 1.0
===========
- Major source code reorganization: only the relevant constructs are 
  loaded using the exec.bat, resulting in faster rule execution
  
- The (run) function is not executed any more by the functions 
  owl-make-instance and owl-insert-value. Use instead the functions 
  owl-make-instance-run and owl-insert-value-run 


Version 0.3
===========
- Support for the owl:complementOf construct (checks if there are
  objects that belong to complement classes)
  
- The call to the j2cf module needs to specify the ?*abbr* flag (config.bat) 
  that denotes whether the prefixes or the namespaces should be used during the
  generation of the triple-based facts (create-facts function). It is recommended 
  to use ?*abbr* = TRUE in config.bat, since it results in faster execution.
  
- Enhanced slot type mappings regarding boolean, nonNegativeInteger, positiveInteger,
  nonPositiveInteger and short ranges
  
- Only the generated code is stored into the bundle folder, without the source
  code of O-DEVICE (modified exec.bat file).

- defglobals for OWL and RDF/RDFS vocabulary 


Version 0.2
===========
- The namespaces are mapped on prefixes for better performance.

- Parameterizes the file/folder paths (through the config.bat).

- Allows the definition of more than one ontology 
  as parameters for the function load_ontology, for
  example, (load-ontology "file:c:\\..." "file:c:\\..." ...)
  
- Fixes some performance problems regarding the 
  loading of ontologies with large number of classes.
  
- Facts of the template PrefixNsMap are generated that 
  contain information about the prefixes mapping on namespaces
  of the loaded ontologies (these mappings are computed 
  by Jena) 

- The function "ns" has been added for substituting the prefix
  with the corresponding namespace.

- The function mapPrefixNs has been added that allows the 
  definition of new mappings for prefixes/namespaces.
  
- CLIPS cannot process symbols that contain the character '~'. 
  This character is removed.
