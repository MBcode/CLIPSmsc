=======
O-DEVICE is a CLIPS-based rule program that transforms OWL
ontologies into the COOL model of CLIPS. It can be used
either as a standalone module by loading it directly into
CLIPS, or through the JO-DEVICE JAVA API 
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/o-device/files/).

Dependencies
============
- At runtime, the standalone O-DEVICE requires the j2cf.jar
  (https://sourceforge.net/projects/o-device/files/) and the 
  JENA 2.6 API libraries (http://jena.sourceforge.net/). The j2cf.jar
  should exist under the odevice distribution folder (odevice\\j2cf.jar)
  and the JENA libraries should exist in a folder lib under the odevice 
  distribution folder (odevice\\lib\\..)
- The CLIPS executable (http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/) 

There is a preconfigured distribution of the standalone O-DEVICE at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/o-device/files/
