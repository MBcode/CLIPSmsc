
How to Use
=============
-> Modify the file odevice/config.bat in order to 
   match your configuration. In principle, only the
   folder path of O-DEVICE needs to be defined.

-> Add to the odevice/prepare.bat file the ontology(ies)
   you want to transform using the load-ontology function, e.g.
   (load-ontology "http://www..." "http://www" "file:c:/work/..")

-> Start the CLIPS rule engine

-> Execute the odevice/config.bat file, i.e.
   CLIPS> (batch* odevice/config.bat)
   
-> Execute the odevice/prepare.bat file, i.e.
   CLIPS> (batch* odevice/prepare.bat)
   
-> Execute the (clear) function of CLIPS or run a complete
   new instance of the CLIPS rule engine.
   
-> Execute the odevice/exec.bat file, i.e.
   CLIPS> (batch* odevice/exec.bat)
   
-> CLIPS contains now the OO model of the ontologies,
   as well as some entailment rules in order to preserve
   some semantics of OWL in the OO model. Any new instance
   should be created using the O-DEVICE function 
   (owl-make-instance instance-name class-name) and the
   values should be inserted into object slots using the
   O-DEVICE function (owl-insert-value instance-name slot value).
